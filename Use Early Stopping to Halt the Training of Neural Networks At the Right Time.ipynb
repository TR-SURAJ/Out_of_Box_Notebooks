    "- A problem with training neural networks is in the choice of the number of training epochs to use\n",
    "- Too many epochs can lead to overfitting of the training dataset, whereas too few may result in an underfit model. Early stopping is a method that allows you to specify an arbitrary large number of training epochs and stop training once the model performance stops improving on a hold out validation dataset\n",
    "- Callbacks provide a way to execute code and interact with the training model process automatically\n",
    "- The EarlyStopping callback will stop training once triggered, but the model at the end of training may not be the model with best performance on the validation dataset.\n",
    "- An additional callback is required that will save the best model observed during training for later use. This is the ModelCheckpoint callback.\n",
    "- The ModelCheckpoint callback is flexible in the way it can be used, but in this case we will use it only to save the best model observed during training as defined by a chosen performance measure on the validation dataset."
