    "- A language model predicts the next word in the sequence based on the specific words that have come before it in the sequence\n",
    "- It is also possible to develop language models at the character level using neural networks. The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and flexibility in handling any words, punctuation, and other document structure. This comes at the cost of requiring larger models that are slower to train\n",
    "- Nevertheless, in the field of neural language models, character-based models offer a lot of promise for a general, flexible and powerful approach to language modeling\n",
    "- A language model must be trained on the text, and in the case of a character-based language model, the input and output sequences must be characters\n",
    "- The number of characters used as input will also define the number of characters that will need to be provided to the model in order to elicit the first predicted character\n",
    "- After the first character has been generated, it can be appended to the input sequence and used as input for the model to generate the next character\n",
    "- Longer sequences offer more context for the model to learn what character to output next but take longer to train and impose more burden on seeding the model when generating text\n",
    "- We will use an arbitrary length of 10 characters for this model"
