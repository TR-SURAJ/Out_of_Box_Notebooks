    "- It involves splitting the multi-class dataset into multiple binary classification problems\n",
    "- A binary classifier is then trained on each binary classification problem and predictions are made using the model that is the most confident\n",
    "- For example, given a multi-class classification problem with examples for each class ‘red,’ ‘blue,’ and ‘green‘. This could be divided into three binary classification datasets as follows:\n",

    "    - Binary Classification Problem 3: green vs [red, blue]\n",
    "- A possible downside of this approach is that it requires one model to be created for each class. For example, three classes requires three models. This could be an issue for large datasets (e.g. millions of rows), slow models (e.g. neural networks), or very large numbers of classes (e.g. hundreds of classes)"
